	There has been a heated discussion about relationship between parents and children among people.Some people agree that parents should manage their own children strictly,so their children's future can be bright.However,others believe that should give children more free time when they start their study,so children can get many friends from thier free time.In my opinion, their views may be a little one-side, as you can see the following points are my summary.

	First of all,parents are best teacher for their own children,and they can teach children all the time.In addition,parents have lots of time to communicate with their own children,which can prevent their children's psycological problems.What's more,there may be parents's education better than schools in some filed.

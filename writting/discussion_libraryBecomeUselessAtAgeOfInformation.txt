# discuss the library become useless at age of information

	There has been a heated discussion about libraries at the age of information among people.

	Some people,especially the younger generation,challenge the value of conventional libraries. When they need any information in their studies or work,they can turn to their computers for help.For this reason,they do not need to go to a library for borrowing or returning one or two books.

	While others,including most old people as well as scholars,value libraries.They love libraries because they can enjoy peace and quitness in an isolated spiritual world.And they also hace access to rare academic works needed for their studies in the libraries.

	In my view,conventional libraries are still available though there is still much room for improving. At the age of information, as long as knowledege is respected and cherished, libraries won`t extinct from our lives. On the other hand, libraries should not refuse the latest information technology,which will enable them to regain those young readers.

# write a letter to Tom to recommending a place to learn Chinese

Dear Tom,

	How`s everything going? Last time you said you felt inclined to learn Chinese but had mo clue where to start.So I`m writting to recommend a place to you - the Confucius Institue, an established language center aimed to promote Chinese language and culture.

	The reason for my recommendation are as follws,Firstly,this Chinese government-funded educational institute is staffed by the most experienced,professional Chinese teachers,which ensures high-quality instruction.You can turn to them whenever you encounter difficult in mastering the tones and the character.Secondly,student there are encouraged to take part in activities ranging from making traditonal food to learning  clligraphy,as a means of exposing them to the appealing aspects of Chinese culture.Besides,the organization is no widely embraced by more thantwo million students. That means you aren`t alone as a beginner and will probably forge deep friendships with other learners.

	Learning a language from scratch won`t be easy. But I believe you`ll find youself having fun while improving your Chinese proficiency.

	Best wishes,

	Li Hua
